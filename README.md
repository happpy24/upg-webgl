### What *is* Unity Party Game?
Unity Party Game is a Party game designed with the best party games in mind! We take inspiration from both board games, and games like Mario Party & Jackbox Games.

Our goal is to make a bigger party game accessible to any and all players where you just need a singular desktop PC. Users use their phone as controllers, so no more buying extra 60$ controllers or purchasing the game individually for every player.

#### Concept
You are in a fallen land, falled by a curse. You and up to 7 other adventurers must seek different Artifacts from every region and destroy them to lift the curse. The First one to the goal wins, who is going to be the new legend of this land?
