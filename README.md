# WebGL - Unity Party Game
A party game developed in Unity you can control with your phone!

Developed by students at [HU](https://www.hu.nl) - Utrecht University of Applied Sciences

### Unity Party Game Family
- [upg-main](https://github.com/happpy24/upg-main) - The Main application which runs on Desktop.
- [upg-site](https://github.com/happpy24/upg-site) - The Website used to host the WebGL application.

### About WebGL
THIS APPLICATION IS DEPRICATED. upg-webgl was merged into upg-main.

Please view upg-main for the actual application files and information.

We chose to make the applications seperate for ease of use for ourselves, but the networking solution we were using: Mirror Networking, does not support this that well. This is why we eventually chose to merge the two and will now be exporting upg-main as a webgl application for the site we developed.

### What *is* Unity Party Game?
Unity Party Game is a Party game designed with the best party games in mind! We take inspiration from both board games, and games like Mario Party & Jackbox Games.

Our goal is to make a bigger party game accessible to any and all players where you just need a singular desktop PC. Users use their phone as controllers, so no more buying extra 60$ controllers or purchasing the game individually for every player.

#### Concept
You are in a fallen land, falled by a curse. You and up to 7 other adventurers must seek different Artifacts from every region and destroy them to lift the curse. The First one to the goal wins, who is going to be the new legend of this land?
